# How to contribute 

Please, submit **issues** and **pull requests** to
[github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/seqfu](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/seqfu):
this module `Proch::N50` is in the 
['n50' subdirectory](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/seqfu/tree/master/n50).

---

Note that the repository (SeqFu) is globally moved to:
[GitHub (telatin/seqfu2)](https://telatin.github.io/seqfu2/),
and the tools have been rewritten in Nim. 
`seqfu stats` provides a great replacement for the `n50` tool
shipping with this library.
