# How to contribute 

Please, submit pull request to github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/seqfu:
this module `Proch::N50` is in the 'n50' subdirectory.

Note that while the repository (SeqFu) is globally moved to:
[GitHub (telatin/seqfu2)](https://telatin.github.io/seqfu2/)

The Perl module `Proch::N50` is still (somehow) maintained there.
